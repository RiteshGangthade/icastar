## Testing Notes

1. **Base URL**: Update the base URL if your application runs on a different port
2. **Authentication**: Ensure you have a valid JWT token for protected endpoints
3. **Pagination**: Use `page` and `size` parameters for pagination
4. **Filtering**: Combine multiple filter parameters for refined searches
5. **Sorting**: Use `sortBy` and `sortDir` parameters for custom sorting

All APIs support comprehensive filtering, pagination, and search capabilities as requested.
