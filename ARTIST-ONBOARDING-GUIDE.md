# üé≠ iCastar Platform - Complete Artist Onboarding Guide

## üìã Overview

This comprehensive guide walks you through the complete process of adding an artist to the iCastar platform. The platform supports a dynamic artist type system with custom fields for different types of artists (Actor, Dancer, Singer, Director, etc.).

## üéØ Prerequisites

Before adding an artist, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ iCastar platform running (http://localhost:8080)
- ‚úÖ Database properly configured
- ‚úÖ Artist types initialized in the system
- ‚úÖ Valid user credentials for testing

## üöÄ Complete Artist Addition Process

### Step 1: Check Available Artist Types

First, verify what artist types are available in the system:

```bash
# Get all available artist types
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/public/artist-types" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "ACTOR",
    "displayName": "Actor",
    "description": "Film, TV, and Theater Actors",
    "iconUrl": "/icons/actor.png",
    "isActive": true,
    "sortOrder": 1,
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "fieldName": "height",
        "displayName": "Height",
        "fieldType": "TEXT",
        "isRequired": true,
        "isSearchable": true,
        "sortOrder": 1,
        "placeholder": "cm",
        "helpText": "Height in centimeters"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Step 2: Get Artist Type Fields (Optional)

To see all fields for a specific artist type:

```bash
# Get fields for Actor type (ID: 1)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/public/artist-types/1/fields" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Step 3: User Registration

Before creating an artist profile, you need to register a user account:

```bash
# Register a new user with ARTIST role
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.actor@example.com",
    "mobile": "+919876543210",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "ARTIST",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "john.actor@example.com",
    "mobile": "+919876543210",
    "role": "ARTIST",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "isVerified": true
  }
}
```

### Step 4: User Authentication

Login to get JWT token for authenticated requests:

```bash
# Option 1: OTP-based login (if implemented)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/otp/send" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mobile": "+919876543210"
  }'

# Then verify OTP
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/otp/verify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mobile": "+919876543210",
    "otp": "123456"
  }'

# Option 2: Email/Password login (if implemented)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.actor@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "email": "john.actor@example.com",
      "role": "ARTIST"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Create Artist Profile

Now create the artist profile with the JWT token:

```bash
# Create artist profile
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/artists/profile" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "artistTypeId": 1,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",

      },
      {
        "artistTypeFieldId": 2,
        "fieldValue": "75"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

    "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Verify Artist Profile Creation

Check if the artist profile was created successfully:

```bash
# Get current artist profile
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/artists/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Step 7: Update Artist Profile (Optional)

  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
